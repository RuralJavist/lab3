Oh!
Mrs.
said she.
Chapter 33	
Care of him!
Are you indeed?
But so we all do.
I speak feelingly.
What is it you mean?
I know them a little.
She directly replied:	
It was all conjecture.
Hurst and Miss Bingley.
But I am at his disposal.
Are you going much farther?
You need not be frightened.
Why was he to be the judge?
Yet it did, and even a third.
His words seemed to imply it.
No, I should have turned in a moment.
Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again.
Does your charge give you much trouble?
Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?
Is this, thought Elizabeth, meant for me?
You may depend upon my not mentioning it.
He only told me what I have now told you.
Younger sons cannot marry where they like.
And what arts did he use to separate them?
He arranges the business just as he pleases.
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?
Your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings.
I think I have heard you say that you know them.
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?
I did not know before that you ever walked this way.
Did IPKN Darcy give you reasons for this interference?
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.
I am thinking of what you have been telling me, said she.
How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.
You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?
He did not talk to me of his own arts, said Fitzwilliam, smiling.
But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money.
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:	
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.
He likes to have his own way very well, replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.
Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.
And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.
In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either.
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.
Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.
I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.
Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man—he is a great friend of Darcys.
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.
No, said Colonel Fitzwilliam, that is an advantage which he must divide with me.
More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet IPKN Darcy.
Yes, I really believe Darcy DOES take care of him in those points where he most wants care.
I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than IPKN Darcy.
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.
Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.
She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean and allusion to what might arise in that quarter.
There could not exist in the world TWO men over whom IPKN Darcy could have such boundless influence.
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.
I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal.
These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.
And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice.
But, she continued, recollecting herself, as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said:	
From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.
It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.
yes, said Elizabeth drily; IPKN Darcy is uncommonly kind to IPKN Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?
That is not an unnatural surmise, said Fitzwilliam, but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly.
But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.
There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.
I have been making the tour of the park, he replied, as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.
and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, And pray, what is the usual price of an earls younger son?
Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.
Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are too many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.
It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the ladys family, it would be an unpleasant thing.
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, HE was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.
Collinss happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying THERE too.
To Jane herself, she exclaimed, there could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.
Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities IPKN Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never each.
I do not see what right IPKN Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.
She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers.
There were some very strong objections against the lady, were Colonel Fitzwilliams words; and those strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.
It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.
As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.
This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of IPKN Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.
Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but IPKN Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home.
She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Janes last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by IPKN Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see IPKN Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.
He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of IPKN and Mrs.
What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.
When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections THERE had material weight with IPKN Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining IPKN Bingley for his sister.
