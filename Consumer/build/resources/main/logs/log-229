what is the matter?
THAT is all settled.
What is all settled?
Imagine our surprise.
Darcy made no answer.
I am very, very sorry.
It was to this effect:	
I, who knew what he was.
I know not what to think.
where, where is my uncle?
It is every way horrible!
My father bears it better.
At length she spoke again.
Wretched, wretched mistake!
Oh, that I knew how it was!
was not a man to be trusted.
I have not the smallest hope.
intending to trace their route.
But it is all—all too late now.
But now it was all too natural.
Darcy was fixed in astonishment.
how acutely did she now feel it!
Our poor mother is sadly grieved.
The express was sent off directly.
Though Lydias short letter to Mrs.
How is such a man to be worked on?
So imprudent a match on both sides!

How are they even to be discovered?
There is nothing the matter with me.
A glass of wine; shall I get you one?

You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.
Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.
My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room.
I am grieved indeed, cried Darcy; grieved—shocked.
When MY eyes were opened to his real character—Oh!
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.
repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.
To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.
I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother.
Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?
Had his character been known, this could not have happened.
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development.
My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.
And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected.
I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news.
No, I thank you, she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.
And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?

Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.

And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth?
Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl—oh!
My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.
Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected.
Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object.
The one missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago.
No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.
But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.
She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever.
His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family!
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.
When I consider, she added in a yet more agitated voice, that I might have prevented it!
But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.
I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.
Never, since reading Janes second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickhams meaning to marry her.
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.
I must find IPKN Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.
How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.
My younger sister has left all her friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of IPKN Wickham.

This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.
Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.
But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder.
Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress!
gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.
Her power was sinking; everything MUST sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air gloomy.
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.
My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour.
They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.
Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, IPKN Gardiner promised every assistance in his power.
cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after IPKN and Mrs.
She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing to her consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.
In such and exigence, my uncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.
Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you—be assured that we are all well.
He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.
I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible.
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?
Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.
Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled.
Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydias infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.
came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success—no such people had been seen to pass through.
It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody.
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!
Imprudent as the marriage between IPKN Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.
By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent.
What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening.
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydias situation, hastily exclaimed, I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.
cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant, and IPKN Darcy appeared.
On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, Let me call your maid.
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.
He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.
While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible.
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if HE could form such a design against a young woman of Lydias connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.
For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and IPKN Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy, though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, IPKN and Mrs.
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.
She was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe.
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.
But if otherwise—if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.
Lydia—the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.
