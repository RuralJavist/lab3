It would be dreadful!
are sufficiently known.
Elizabeth was distressed.
Gardiner abused her stupidity.
Everything wore a happier aspect.
what was the name of its proprietor?
But they did pass away, and IPKN and Mrs.
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.
The period of expectation was now doubled.
Wickham passed all his youth there, you know.
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.
To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs.
They have some of the finest woods in the country.
In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.
Elizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce.
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.
With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival.
But it is fortunate, thought she, that I have something to wish for.
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.
It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.
and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer?
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.
My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?
The possibility of meeting IPKN Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.
said her aunt; a place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected.
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.
IPKN Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.
In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband.
He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.
But it was her business to be satisfied—and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.
Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place?
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.
She blushed at the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk.
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.
But surely, said she, I may enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.
If it were merely a fine house richly furnished, said she, I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.
The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough.
She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
Had Elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.
The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs.
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised.
When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.
A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.
But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc.
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
But IPKN Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice.
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes been found before, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.
Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt—for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.
Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put and end to all real affection for her.
Gardiners former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated.
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.
One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity—to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way—teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.
Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs.
A most welcome negative followed the last question—and her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.
She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.
But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.
IPKN Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire.
Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp.
