As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.
Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly.
Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings.
Upon my word, said her ladyship, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter.
Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means.
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.
Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.
With three younger sisters grown up, replied Elizabeth, smiling, your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourghs being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.
Lady Catherine was generally speaking—stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.
Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.

When they ascended the steps to the hall, Marias alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed.
Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs.
Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.
I confess, said he, that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.
IPKN Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs.
But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy IPKN Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands.
IPKN Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on IPKN Collinss side and as many bows on Sir Williams they departed.
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.
Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.
I am the less surprised at what has happened, replied Sir William, from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.
But really, maam, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.
As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlottes sake, she made more favourable than it really was.
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.
From the entrance-hall, of which IPKN Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs.
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of IPKN Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small.
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, IPKN Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.
He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St.
She inquired into Charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.
She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mothers maiden name?
Jamess Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted.
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which IPKN Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyships desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.
She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought IPKN Wickham immediately to Elizabeths mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherines condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.
Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as IPKN Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.
