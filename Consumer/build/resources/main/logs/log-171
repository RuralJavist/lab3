Chapter 49	
Complied with!
Heaven forbid!
I am so happy!
Is it possible?
Yours, etc.,EDW.
cried Elizabeth.
Here comes Hill!
Jane now came up.
Elizabeth read on:	
Just as you please.
How well it sounds!
And they MUST marry!
Ten thousand pounds!
How strange this is!
My dear, dear Lydia!
She will be married!
My dear, dear Lydia!
Yet he is SUCH a man!
Dear madam, cried Mrs.
I have seen them both.
I shall see her again!
My good, kind brother!
How I long to see her!
What do you mean, Hill?
I have seen them both—	
She comes to us to-day.
I knew how it would be.
Yes, yes, they must marry.
This is delightful indeed!
it must be my uncles doings!
It is useless to talk of it.
and to see dear Wickham too!
Have you heard from my uncle?
No; but it must be done soon.
Stay, stay, I will go myself.
Oh, papa, what news—what news?
She will be married at sixteen!
Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.
We have heard nothing from town.
And have you answered the letter?
There is nothing else to be done.
cried Jane, what do you mean, sir?
A small sum could not do all this.
And they are really to be married!
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.
I knew he would manage everything!
My dear father, I congratulate you.
And for THIS we are to be thankful.
And she was only sixteen last June.
How is half such a sum to be repaid?
Bennet could hardly contain herself.
I will put on my things in a moment.
What is there of good to be expected?
Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.
Take whatever you like, and get away.
But the clothes, the wedding clothes!
But perhaps you would like to read it.
cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.
By this time she is actually with them!
Other schemes, too, came into her head.
Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
Hill began instantly to express her joy.
Can it be possible that he will marry her?
I am only ashamed of his asking so little.
said he, taking the letter from his pocket.
My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?
Yes I have had a letter from him by express.
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?
May we take my uncles letter to read to her?
How merry we shall be together when we meet!
Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?
Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.
He has children of his own, and may have more.
In a short time I shall have a daughter married.
cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.
What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!
And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs.
Consider how important every moment is in such a case.
To know that her daughter would be married was enough.
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.
Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.
I dislike it very much, he replied; but it must be done.
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!
Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.
Then it is as I always hoped, cried Jane; they are married!
my dear father, she cried, come back and write immediately.
He has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.
I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on.
He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied:	
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.
After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.
Let me write for you, said Jane, if you dislike the trouble yourself.
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him, said her sister.
That is very true, said Elizabeth; though it had not occurred to me before.
Read it aloud, said their father, for I hardly know myself what it is about.
Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.
Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he wrote.
If you are looking for my master, maam, he is walking towards the little copse.
And may I ask— said Elizabeth; but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist IPKN Wickham with money.
The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered.
Well, cried her mother, it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?
I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs together.
I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.
If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!
For we must attribute this happy conclusion, she added, in a great measure to his kindness.
Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
Hill, in great astonishment, dont you know there is an express come for master from IPKN Gardiner?
No, said her father; Wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.
His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.
Their conduct has been such, replied Elizabeth, as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.
Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were.
We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve.
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.
Poor Lydias situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.
My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I cant write; so I will dictate, and you write for me.
I will go to Meryton, said she, as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.
IPKN Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.
We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side, said Jane: I hope and trust they will yet be happy.
They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice.
I comfort myself with thinking, replied Jane, that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her.
One days delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual.
MY DEAR BROTHER,At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction.
These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.
You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that IPKN Wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.
I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced.
As soon as Jane had read IPKN Gardiners hope of Lydias being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.
But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.
Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:	
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.
If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents.
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which IPKN Gardiners behaviour laid them all under.
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.
They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said:	
If he were ever able to learn what Wickhams debts have been, said Elizabeth, and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what IPKN Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted.
She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.
All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum.
Two days after IPKN Bennets return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.
