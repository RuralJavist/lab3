Jenkinsons room.
So much the better.
Then pray speak aloud.
Let me hear what it is.
He drew a chair near her.
My fingers wait your orders.
What is it you are talking of?
She practises very constantly.
What are you telling Miss Bennet?
It is of all subjects my delight.
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?
IPKN Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.
We neither of us perform to strangers.
You have employed your time much better.
What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
I am not afraid of you, said he, smilingly.
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?
Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?
Darcy smiled and said, You are perfectly right.
It is because he will not give himself the trouble.
I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.
said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.
True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.
And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.
My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.
I will not be alarmed though your sister DOES play so well.
If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.
Collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.
She would be in nobodys way, you know, in that part of the house.
I assure you, madam, he replied, that she does not need such advice.
IPKN Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency.
You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
I can answer your question, said Fitzwilliam, without applying to him.
Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of, cried Colonel Fitzwilliam.
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.
You mean to frighten me, IPKN Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?
For the last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter.
We are speaking of music, madam, said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.
She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Annes.
IPKN Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts ill-breeding, and made no answer.
They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.
Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:	
I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.
It is not that I do not believe MY fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution.
I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice.
I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault—because I will not take the trouble of practising.
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.
Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:	
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherines drawing-room.
My fingers, said Elizabeth, do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many womens do.
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeths performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but IPKN Darcy they had seen only at church.
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think he did?
I certainly have not the talent which some people possess, said Darcy, of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.
Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?
Perhaps, said Darcy, I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.
He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.
I am very glad to hear such a good account of her, said Lady Catherine; and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal.
Colonel Fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings.
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home.
HIS eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:	
Indeed, IPKN Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance.
Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.
I shall not say you are mistaken, he replied, because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry HER, had she been his relation.
He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of IPKN Darcy.
It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither—for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemens arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.
