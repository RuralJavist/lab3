Oh!
shocking!
Chapter 11	
cried Elizabeth.
cried Elizabeth.
What could he mean?
cried Miss Bingley.
You are safe from me.
No one made any reply.
I dearly love a laugh.
Tease him—laugh at him.
Such as vanity and pride.
THAT is a failing indeed!
IPKN Darcy may hug himself.
I really cannot LAUGH at it.
But upon my honour, I do NOT.
My temper I dare not vouch for.
He was full of joy and attention.
No, no—feel he may defy us there.
Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.
IPKN Darcy is not to be laughed at!
He owns it himself without disguise.
But you have chosen your fault well.
I never heard anything so abominable.
And YOUR defect is to hate everybody.
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.
We can all plague and punish one another.
How shall we punish him for such a speech?
My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.
My temper would perhaps be called resentful.
Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind!
I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
Their powers of conversation were considerable.
No, said Darcy, I have made no such pretension.
Louisa, you will not mind my waking IPKN Hurst?
Implacable resentment IS a shade in a character.
How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!
Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.
But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me THAT.
Miss Bingley, said he, has given me more credit than can be.
I am perfectly convinced by it that IPKN Darcy has no defect.
Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination, said Elizabeth.
I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
And yours, he replied with a smile, is willfully to misunderstand them.
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.
I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.
By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?
Certainly, replied Elizabeth—there are such people, but I hope I am not one of THEM.
Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room.
When tea was over, IPKN Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table—but in vain.
When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; IPKN Darcy looked up.
Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.
It is, I believe, too little yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world.
Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.
But pride—where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.
She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.
Your examination of IPKN Darcy is over, I presume, said Miss Bingley; and pray what is the result?
IPKN Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.
I have not the smallest objection to explaining them, said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.
I cannot forget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself.
Do let us have a little music, cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.
In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:	
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day.
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, DO divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.
And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.
She was dying to know what could be his meaning?—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her.
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.
Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brothers conversation with Miss Bennet.
She had obtained private intelligence that IPKN Darcy did not wish for cards; and IPKN Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.
That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to ME to have many such acquaintances.
Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.
There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil—a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.
Not at all, was her answer; but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.
The wisest and the best of men—nay, the wisest and best of their actions—may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing IPKN Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.
I should like balls infinitely better, she replied, if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.
He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; IPKN Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was very glad; but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingleys salutation.
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.
Miss Bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching IPKN Darcys progress through HIS book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.
I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.
The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door.
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:	
If you mean Darcy, cried her brother, he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards.
At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!
He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.
