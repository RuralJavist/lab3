Oh!

Chapter 26	
Hurst were going out.
I wish I could see her.
I cannot understand it.
THAT you certainly shall.
Will you come and see me?
I see the imprudence of it.
THAT abominable IPKN Darcy!
In short, I will do my best.
We had better not mention it.
Let me hear from you very soon.
All this was acknowledged to Mrs.
There can be no love in all this.
Elizabeth, you are not serious now.
You must not disappoint your father.
I beg your pardon, I will try again.
And I have another favour to ask you.
I dare say I shall see them soon here.
I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.
I inquired after their brother, of course.
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.
My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.
Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.
My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs.
Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.
I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.
We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.
My father, however, is partial to IPKN Wickham.
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.
You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.
As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:	
But do not imagine that he is always here so often.
I will take care of myself, and of IPKN Wickham too.
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.
Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.
He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.
I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.
Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.
She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.
I am sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc.
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.
At least, you should not REMIND you mother of inviting him.
But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you.
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.
I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her.
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.
At present I am not in love with IPKN Wickham; no, I certainly am not.
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
Your father would depend on YOUR resolution and good conduct, I am sure.
Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often.
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.
Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.
He was well, but so much engaged with IPKN Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him.
You know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.
But my feelings are not only cordial towards HIM; they are even impartial towards Miss King.
It convinced her that accident only could discover to IPKN Bingley her sisters being in town.
My fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it.
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.
She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime.
My father and Maria are coming to me in March, added Charlotte, and I hope you will consent to be of the party.
But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side.
I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.
As I did the other day, said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT.
Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingleys inattention.
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging.
I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.
My aunt, she continued, is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.
I did not think Caroline in spirits, were her words, but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that SHE would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.
I have nothing to say against HIM; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.
But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should not.
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual.
It was IPKN Collinss picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest.
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.
They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy—your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.
My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingleys regard for me.
Gardiners caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:	
IPKN Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.
His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she WISHED they might be happy.
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.
But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.
Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.
He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.
My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggle to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.
Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.
His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry IPKN Darcys sister, as by Wickhams account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlottes, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
I need not explain myself farther; and though WE know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable.
Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.
When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.
Charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.
In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?
