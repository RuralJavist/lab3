my dear Lydia, she cried, when shall we meet again?
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.
It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.
She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.
I began to be afraid you would never come back again.
How IPKN Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.
As soon as ever IPKN Bingley comes, my dear, said Mrs.
The day of his and Lydias departure soon came, and Mrs.
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!

Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.
If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.

But, perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.
Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything.
He is as fine a fellow, said IPKN Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, as ever I saw.
I wish I could say anything to comfort you, replied Elizabeth; but it is wholly out of my power.
More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed.

She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.
It was my brother Gardiners drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.

to Miss Lydia Bennet, without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.
They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long.
Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at IPKN Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business.
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:	
It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.
At that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.
You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.
Well, any friend of IPKN Bingleys will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.
He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.
Yet it is hard, she sometimes thought, that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation!
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.
She was going to the butchers, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.
When you have killed all your own birds, IPKN Bingley, said her mother, I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on IPKN Bennets manor.
Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.
You are quite a visit in my debt, IPKN Bingley, she added, for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.
Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could.
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window—she looked,—she saw IPKN Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.
Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.
It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married, continued her mother, but at the same time, IPKN Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.
It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door.
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation.
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.
On the gentlemens appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.
Her astonishment at his coming—at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see IPKN Bingley, in consequence of it, before THEY did.
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover.
Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of IPKN Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as IPKN Bingleys friend, without being heard by either of them.
Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.
IPKN Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.
But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there WITH his friends permission, or being bold enough to come without it.
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley.
