Chapter 48	
A gamester!
It was as follows:	
YOU go to Brighton.
I had not an idea of it.
This is wholly unexpected.
Jane heard them with horror.
Who should suffer but myself?
It will pass away soon enough.
Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs.
Do you suppose them to be in London?
She shared in their attendance on Mrs.
At present we have nothing to guide us.
Human nature is so prone to fall into it!
Then after a short silence he continued:	
You may well warn me against such an evil.
There was also a postscript to this effect:	
Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?
What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?
It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.
Well, well, said he, do not make yourself unhappy.
And Lydia used to want to go to London, added Kitty.
Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
I am not going to run away, papa, said Kitty fretfully.
You must not be too severe upon yourself, replied Elizabeth.
IPKN Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds!
Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom.
Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?
If I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.
It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mothers tea.
The arrival of letters was the grand object of every mornings impatience.
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.
Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.
He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.
Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
IPKN Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family.
No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.
No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village.
When IPKN Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head.
There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.
Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.
This is a parade, he cried, which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!
Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.
If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.
She is happy then, said her father drily; and her residence there will probably be of some duration.
Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs.
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.
He added that IPKN Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon.
But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other person.
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.
And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.
IPKN Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.
They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of THAT they would have been glad to be certain.
If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world.
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from IPKN Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
IPKN Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.
IPKN Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.
His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that IPKN Bennet came from it.
Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.
Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.
His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.
Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesmans family.
Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.
No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune—or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parents mind.
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.
Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.
It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ——shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.
It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, Say nothing of that.
Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.I am, dear sir, etc., etc.
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?
MY DEAR SIR,I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.
And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydias relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-laws entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.
I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself.
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs.
Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up—though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickhams extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on IPKN Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel.
But before they heard again from IPKN Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from IPKN Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.
The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from THAT, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydias infamy somewhat better.
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.
IPKN Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that IPKN Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as IPKN Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.
