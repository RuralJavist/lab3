True.
I am not.
No, never.
Very well.
Chapter 56	
It is well.
Collins well.
Yes, very well.
Let us sit down.
I came to try you.
Hear me in silence.
I am ashamed of you!
Yes, madam, said Mrs.
Is this to be endured!
But what is that to me?
You know my sentiments.
This is not to be borne.
But who was your mother?
I have by no means done.
Unfeeling, selfish girl!
Now what have you to say?
I never heard that it was.
You may have drawn him in.
I will not be interrupted.
And she rose as she spoke.
I have said no such thing.
Obstinate, headstrong girl!
This is your final resolve!
Not so hasty, if you please.
I shall now know how to act.
Let me be rightly understood.
But it must not, shall not be.
You ARE a gentlemans daughter.
Who are your uncles and aunts?
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
And this is your real opinion!
You deserve no such attention.
Yes, and I had heard it before.
You refuse, then, to oblige me.
I am most seriously displeased.
It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
She is my youngest girl but one.
Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.
I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.
I saw them the night before last.
Her ladyship was highly incensed.
She is a very fine-looking woman!
Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?
Its completion depended on others.
I must beg to return to the house.
You are then resolved to have him?
Is nothing due to me on that score?
I will make no promise of the kind.
said she, as she looked in her face.
And I certainly NEVER shall give it.
That lady, I suppose, is your mother.
IPKN Darcy is engaged to my daughter.
I send no compliments to your mother.
What could your ladyship propose by it?
Their fortune on both sides is splendid.
Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.
Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.
And THAT I suppose is one of your sisters.
How could I ever think her like her nephew?
And is such a girl to be my nephews sister?
Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking?
To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh?
and her calling here was prodigiously civil!
Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.
You have insulted me in every possible method.
Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say.
Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.
Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.
These are heavy misfortunes, replied Elizabeth.
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.
The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?
If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.
I have not been accustomed to such language as this.
I have not been used to submit to any persons whims.
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.
Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?
But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?
She did not choose it, said her daughter, she would go.
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.
You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:	
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?
A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago.
From their infancy, they have been intended for each other.
You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage.
It was the favourite wish of HIS mother, as well as of hers.
Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?
You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.
I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.
And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.
And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?
You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.
You can now have nothing further to say, she resentfully answered.
He is a gentleman; I am a gentlemans daughter; so far we are equal.
I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.
But however insincere YOU may choose to be, you shall not find ME so.
At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.
To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.
No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with IPKN Darcy.
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.
It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.
Is her husband, is the son of his late fathers steward, to be his brother?
After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,	
Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then added:	
I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.
May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left IPKN and Mrs.
You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.
In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.
You have a very small park here, returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.
Go, my dear, cried her mother, and show her ladyship about the different walks.
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement.
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:—	
You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it.
Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.
Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?
Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.
Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.
THAT will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me.
This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west.
You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs.
But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.
Miss Bennet, replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.
If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.
If IPKN Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.
Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?
Whatever my connections may be, said Elizabeth, if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to YOU.
Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude, replied Elizabeth, have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.
I know it all; that the young mans marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.
The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?
It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucass.
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.
Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.
Your ladyship wants IPKN Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable?
If you believed it impossible to be true, said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.
Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family, said Elizabeth coolly, will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.
They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the fathers, from respectable, honourable, and ancient—though untitled—families.
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moments deliberation:	
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered.
My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh.
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.
I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to YOU, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.
But the wife of IPKN Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.
As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.
As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,	
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.
Though I KNOW it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.
I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, IPKN Darcy.
And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former WERE excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moments concern—and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.
While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family!
One morning, about a week after Bingleys engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.
