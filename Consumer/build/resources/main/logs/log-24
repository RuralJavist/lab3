Mrs.
Mrs.
Thank God!
Chapter 24	
My dear Jane!
You need not.
Yes; to the last.
Now is your time.
But enough of this.
I congratulate her.
It cannot last long.
It is unaccountable!
I cannot believe it.
I have not THAT pain.
But I will not repine.
Stop me whilst you can.
Let Wickham be YOUR man.
When is your turn to come?
You mentioned TWO instances.
Your first position is false.
They will ruin your happiness.
You alluded to something else.
Do not distress me by the idea.
In every view it is unaccountable!
And men take care that they should.
Yes, in conjunction with his friend.
Why should they try to influence him?
exclaimed Elizabeth, you are too good.
Nay, said Elizabeth, this is not fair.
And do you impute it to either of those?
We must not all expect Janes good fortune.
IPKN Bennet treated the matter differently.
Miss Darcys praise occupied the chief of it.
Women fancy admiration means more than it does.
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.
Miss Bingleys letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.
Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!
You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.
He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.
My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.
You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?
Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.
A little time, therefore—I shall certainly try to get the better.
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.
I only want to think YOU perfect, and you set yourself against it.
So, Lizzy, said he one day, your sister is crossed in love, I find.
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.
I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.
You doubt me, cried Jane, slightly colouring; indeed, you have no reason.
Bennets best comfort was that IPKN Bingley must be down again in the summer.
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.
Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.
Consider IPKN Collinss respectability, and Charlottes steady, prudent character.
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.
She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.
YOU wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.
To Carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.
Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all others.
It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you.
They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.
They can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.
It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.
I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlottes marriage.
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers.
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.
By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs.
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will.
Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other peoples feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection.
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time IPKN Bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
Bennets leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying:	
Beyond a doubt, they DO wish him to choose Miss Darcy, replied Jane; but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.
If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.
I must think your language too strong in speaking of both, replied Jane; and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together.
I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking THAT PERSON to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.
IPKN Wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.
True, said IPKN Bennet, but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it.
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of IPKN Darcys house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.
With a stronger voice she soon added, I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.
I am far from attributing any part of IPKN Bingleys conduct to design, said Elizabeth; but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.
They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.
Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.
Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybodys sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.
My dear Jane, IPKN Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking.
Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sisters was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.
You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.
The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.
To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on IPKN Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked IPKN Darcy before they had known anything of the matter.
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but by everybody else IPKN Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination.
She could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingleys regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends interference; whether he had been aware of Janes attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sisters situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.
