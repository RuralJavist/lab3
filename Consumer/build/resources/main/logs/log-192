Removed!
Chapter 9	
cried Bingley.
So genteel and easy!
That is as it happens.
No, she would go home.
Yes, indeed, cried Mrs.
But, however, he did not.
It must not be thought of.
It is what everybody says.
So much the man of fashion!
It must be an amusing study.
Did Charlotte dine with you?
You quite mistook IPKN Darcy.
cried he, turning towards her.
yes—I understand you perfectly.
I do not trust my own partiality.
Perhaps he thought her too young.
Lydia declared herself satisfied.
They have at least that advantage.
Indeed I have, sir, was her answer.
You begin to comprehend me, do you?
It is a pity they are not handsome!
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs.
She seems a very pleasant young woman.
Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.
She is a great deal too ill to be moved.
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
Yes, she called yesterday with her father.
He had always something to say to everybody.
I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies.
Everything nourishes what is strong already.
I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.
dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs.
IPKN Jones says we must not think of moving her.
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.
My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.
Yes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing.
Aye—that is because you have the right disposition.
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to HER.
But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.
And so ended his affection, said Elizabeth impatiently.
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.
There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.
What an agreeable man Sir William is, IPKN Bingley, is not he?
The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, IPKN Bingley?
Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.
However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.
Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Janes beauty.
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.
That is exactly what I should have supposed of you, said Elizabeth.
I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of love, said Darcy.
Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.
They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear:	
Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken, said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.
The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.
I assure you there is quite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town.
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.
Not that I think Charlotte so VERY plain—but then she is our particular friend.
The country, said Darcy, can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study.
But that gentleman, looking at Darcy, seemed to think the country was nothing at all.
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.
She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
And when you have given YOUR ball, she added, I shall insist on their giving one also.
You have a sweet room here, IPKN Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk.
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.
I did not know before, continued Bingley immediately, that your were a studier of character.
Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.
But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.
Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards IPKN Darcy with a very expressive smile.
But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you.
It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.
I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not often see anybody better looking.
When I am in the country, he replied, I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.
I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places.
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.
Lizzy, cried her mother, remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.
For my part, IPKN Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; MY daughters are brought up very differently.
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to IPKN Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.
yes—it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.
IPKN Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.
Whatever I do is done in a hurry, replied he; and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.
He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true.
THAT is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.
I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball.
You may depend upon it, Madam, said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us.
Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingleys appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour.
Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since HER coming away.
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation.
She would not listen, therefore, to her daughters proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.
When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.
She was very equal, therefore, to address IPKN Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.
She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncles good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.
Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax IPKN Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from IPKN Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.
I am sure, she added, if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with.
Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and IPKN Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of HER, in spite of all Miss Bingleys witticisms on FINE EYES.
