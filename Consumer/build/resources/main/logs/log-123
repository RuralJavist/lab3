Oh!
How so?
Design!
Bingley.
Chapter 1	
What is his name?
How can it affect them?
Is he married or single?
My dear, you flatter me.
You mistake me, my dear.
They are my old friends.
IPKN Bennet made no answer.
cried his wife impatiently.
This was invitation enough.
I see no occasion for that.
Single, my dear, to be sure!
But consider your daughters.
Nonsense, how can you talk so!
You take delight in vexing me.
What a fine thing for our girls!
You are over-scrupulous, surely.
But it is, returned she; for Mrs.
Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs.
I desire you will do no such thing.
IPKN Bennet replied that he had not.
Is that his design in settling here?
I have a high respect for your nerves.
HER mind was less difficult to develop.
Do you not want to know who has taken it?
You have no compassion for my poor nerves.
It is more than I engage for, I assure you.
But you are always giving HER the preference.
Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.
When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.
YOU want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.
A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.
In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.
IPKN Bennet, how CAN you abuse your own children in such a way?
My dear IPKN Bennet, replied his wife, how can you be so tiresome!
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do not.
She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.
I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.
But, my dear, you must indeed go and see IPKN Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.
When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.
The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.
I certainly HAVE had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.
My dear IPKN Bennet, said his lady to him one day, have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
But it is very likely that he MAY fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers.
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia.
They have none of them much to recommend them, replied he; they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.
You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, IPKN Bingley may like you the best of the party.
IPKN Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.
I dare say IPKN Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with IPKN Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.
