Chapter 38	
Good gracious!
Poor Charlotte!
Gardiner, though unknown.
How much I shall have to tell!
You see on what a footing we are.
and yet how many things have happened!
Lady Catherines great attentions to Mrs.
You see how continually we are engaged there.
We seem to have been designed for each other.
it was melancholy to leave her to such society!
I know not, Miss Elizabeth, said he, whether Mrs.
A great many indeed, said her companion with a sigh.
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so.
The favor of your company has been much felt, I assure you.
We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode.
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.
Elizabeth added privately, And how much I shall have to conceal!
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.
We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
IPKN Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:	
It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.
There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.
cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, it seems but a day or two since we first came!
You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.
Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.
But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.
It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of IPKN Darcys proposals.
But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make HER feel the obliged.
But, he added, you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here.
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.
Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunateâ€”but on this point it will be as well to be silent.
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached IPKN Gardiners house, where they were to remain a few days.
In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and IPKN Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.
We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.
Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.
After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by IPKN Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to IPKN and Mrs.
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further.
