Chapter 2	
What say you, Mary?
To-morrow fortnight.
I do not believe Mrs.
Well, how pleased I am!
You tear them to pieces.
Long will do any such thing.
I honour your circumspection.
She has two nieces of her own.
Long promised to introduce him.
The girls stared at their father.
said she, when the door was shut.
When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?
I cannot quite agree with you THERE.
Bennet said only, Nonsense, nonsense!
Have a little compassion on my nerves.
I hope IPKN Bingley will like it, Lizzy.
Aye, so it is, cried her mother, and Mrs.
But I knew I should persuade you at last.
What an excellent father you have, girls!
I am sick of IPKN Bingley, cried his wife.
How good it was in you, my dear IPKN Bennet!
It was then disclosed in the following manner.
Dont keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heavens sake!
A fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little.
What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?
Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
I do not cough for my own amusement, replied Kitty fretfully.
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.
But if WE do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs.
I am sorry to hear THAT; but why did not you tell me that before?
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
IPKN Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on IPKN Bingley.
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.
Kitty has no discretion in her coughs, said her father; she times them ill.
If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him.
While Mary is adjusting her ideas, he continued, let us return to IPKN Bingley.
said Lydia stoutly, I am not afraid; for though I AM the youngest, Im the tallest.
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:	
Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce IPKN Bingley to HER.
Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?
For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.
But you forget, mamma, said Elizabeth, that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs.
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.
I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter.
No more have I, said IPKN Bennet; and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.
Impossible, IPKN Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?
Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
Lydia, my love, though you ARE the youngest, I dare say IPKN Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.
We are not in a way to know WHAT IPKN Bingley likes, said her mother resentfully, since we are not to visit.
and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now.
Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.
Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose, said IPKN Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything.
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return IPKN Bennets visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.
Long and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.
He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.
