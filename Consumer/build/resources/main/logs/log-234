La!
Oh!
Oh, lord!
They came.
Chapter 51	
IPKN Darcy!
Good gracious!
Must it be so?
No one but Mrs.
I quite forgot!
said her mother.
But gracious me!
You are so strange!
Jane was distressed.
She longed to see Mrs.
What will Wickham say?
Is not he a charming man?
It was to be such a secret!
Hill and the two housemaids.
They must all go to Brighton.
Smiles decked the face of Mrs.
Her father lifted up his eyes.
yes;—there is nothing in that.
I shall like it of all things.
I promised them so faithfully!
There was no want of discourse.
I should like it beyond anything!
We were married, you know, at St.
Elizabeth could bear it no longer.
That is the place to get husbands.
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.
Her ease and good spirits increased.
But I must tell you how it went off.
I am sure my sisters must all envy me.
Not one party, or scheme, or anything.
repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.
I ought not to have said a word about it.
You may depend upon my seeking no further.
Very true; and if I had my will, we should.
IPKN Darcy had been at her sisters wedding.
I only hope they may have half my good luck.
What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!
Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know.
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.
Clements, because Wickhams lodgings were in that parish.
mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day?
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.
Lizzy, I never gave YOU an account of my wedding, I believe.
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.
You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.
The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them.
But my dear Lydia, I dont at all like your going such a way off.
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock.
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.
And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.
If it was to be secret, said Jane, say not another word on the subject.
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.
To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.
But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.
Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman.
Their reception from IPKN Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.
No really, replied Elizabeth; I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.
Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called Mrs.
The carriage was sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by dinner-time.
when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!
certainly, said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; we will ask you no questions.
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.
Lydias voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.
If youll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.
Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.
However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.
Thank you, said Lydia, for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.
Wickhams affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydias for him.
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:	
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.
Well, mamma, said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, and what do you think of my husband?
Their sisters wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.
And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.
She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.
I thank you for my share of the favour, said Elizabeth; but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.
Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man IPKN Stone.
Wickham by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs.
IPKN Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.
Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.
She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour.
These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, Oh!
He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.
However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for IPKN Darcy might have done as well.
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mothers right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, Ah!
And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.
Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.
Only think of its being three months, she cried, since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.
Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.
Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.
Not that I SHALL, though, she added to herself, as she finished the letter; and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.
You may readily comprehend, she added, what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.
She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.
Janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;—till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.
I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.
