Chapter 3	
Hursts gown—	
Not all that Mrs.
Which do you mean?
I certainly shall not.
I quite detest the man.
His character was decided.
You had much better dance.
I wish you had been there.
I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
Bennet was quite disconcerted.
Elizabeth felt Janes pleasure.
He is so excessively handsome!
Here she was interrupted again.
They found IPKN Bennet still up.
Her report was highly favourable.
Nothing could be more delightful!
IPKN Bingley followed his advice.
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.
Not handsome enough to dance with!
And his sisters are charming women.
IPKN Darcy danced only once with Mrs.
my dear, I am quite delighted with him.
Sir William had been delighted with him.
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.
What a contrast between him and his friend!
For Gods sake, say no more of his partners.
Come, Darcy, said he, I must have you dance.
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her!
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs.
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.
She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!
O that he had sprained his ankle in the first place!
At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable.
IPKN Bennet protested against any description of finery.
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him!
His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.
Only think of THAT, my dear; he actually danced with her twice!
I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.
He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.
I would not be so fastidious as you are, cried IPKN Bingley, for a kingdom!
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs.
I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs.
If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield, said Mrs.
You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.
So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.
Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.
IPKN Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.
IPKN Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.
Bennet to her husband, and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.
In a few days IPKN Bingley returned IPKN Bennets visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.
If he had had any compassion for ME, cried her husband impatiently, he would not have danced half so much!
my dear IPKN Bennet, as she entered the room, we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.
YOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room, said IPKN Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
Everybody said how well she looked; and IPKN Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!
IPKN Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable.
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of IPKN Bingleys heart were entertained.
IPKN Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc.
Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.
They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.
He had rather hoped that his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.
But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.
Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.
She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.
But I can assure you, she added, that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting HIS fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.
And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—IPKN Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.
Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the BOULANGER—	
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of IPKN Darcy.
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of IPKN Bingley.
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London—his five sisters and a cousin.
IPKN Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.
They attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that IPKN Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt ME; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, IPKN Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and IPKN Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.
His brother-in-law, IPKN Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend IPKN Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than IPKN Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.
