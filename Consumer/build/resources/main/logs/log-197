Ah!
Mrs.
said Mrs.
Chapter 14	
Is she handsome?
Has she any family?
Has she been presented?
Does she live near you, sir?
And what sort of young lady is she?
I think you said she was a widow, sir?
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.
IPKN Collins was eloquent in her praise.
IPKN Bennet could not have chosen better.
She is a most charming young lady indeed.
Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.
IPKN Bennets expectations were fully answered.
But I will no longer importune my young cousin.
Bennet, and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.
That is all very proper and civil, I am sure, said Mrs.
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.
Bennet, shaking her head, then she is better off than many girls.
Then turning to IPKN Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.
Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyces Sermons.
She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.
It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when IPKN Denny comes back from town.
Lady Catherine de Bourghs attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but HE had never seen anything but affability in her.
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.
The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyships residence.
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?
Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.
You judge very properly, said IPKN Bennet, and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but IPKN Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:	
IPKN Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.
I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:	
These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.
Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornaments.
By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and IPKN Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.
Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.
IPKN Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.
They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.
During dinner, IPKN Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself—some shelves in the closet upstairs.
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydias interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but IPKN Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with IPKN Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.
