Chapter 10	
Perhaps I do.
He was silent.
You are mistaken.
He made no answer.
Do not you, Darcy?
When you told Mrs.
Indeed I do not dare.
I write rather slowly.
Let me mend it for you.
it is of no consequence.
Letters of business, too!
You write uncommonly fast.
I shall see her in January.
No, no; stay where you are.
I mend pens remarkably well.
Hurst and Elizabeth herself.
The path just admitted three.
Hurst was observing their game.
How odious I should think them!
She smiled, but made no answer.
The supposition did not pain her.
We had better go into the avenue.
Thank you—but I always mend my own.
I am afraid you do not like your pen.
Arguments are too much like disputes.
How can you contrive to write so even?
The loo-table, however, did not appear.
You used us abominably ill, answered Mrs.
This walk is not wide enough for our party.
I see your design, Bingley, said his friend.
Put them next to your great-uncle the judge.
Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.
At present I have not room to do them justice.
The day passed much as the day before had done.
I have already told her so once, by your desire.
He studies too much for words of four syllables.
My style of writing is very different from yours.
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.
You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.
IPKN Hurst and IPKN Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.
She liked him too little to care for his approbation.
IPKN Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs.
IPKN Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said:	
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.
You have shown him off now much more than he did himself.
How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!
Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?
He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.
You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage.
Hurst, running away without telling us that you were coming out.
It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.
Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?
Your humility, IPKN Bingley, said Elizabeth, must disarm reproof.
And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece of modesty?
They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines.
But do you always write such charming long letters to her, IPKN Darcy?
cried Miss Bingley, Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.
Nothing is more deceitful, said Darcy, than the appearance of humility.
How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year!
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.
To yield readily—easily—to the PERSUASION of a friend is no merit with you.
To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.
Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself.
They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.
Then taking the disengaged arm of IPKN Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about IPKN Bingley.
said she, I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.
Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered:	
It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill.
You appear to me, IPKN Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.
Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.
I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music.
You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.
He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.
You have only proved by this, cried Elizabeth, that IPKN Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.
What you ask, said Elizabeth, is no sacrifice on my side; and IPKN Darcy had much better finish his letter.
She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.
That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline, cried her brother, because he does NOT write with ease.
I did not know that you intended to walk, said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.
Nay, cried Bingley, this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.
As for your Elizabeths picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.
IPKN Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.
I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare.
Would IPKN Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.
I am exceedingly gratified, said Bingley, by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.
I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.
It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.
My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.
The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards IPKN Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her:	
IPKN Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.
She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.
Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.
By all means, cried Bingley; let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.
You wanted me, I know, to say Yes, that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.
Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently IPKN Darcys eyes were fixed on her.
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.
Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantleys.
Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?
The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.
The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.
Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, Bingley, you had better stay till next week, you would probably do it, you would probably not go—and at another word, might stay a month.
Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.
I hope, said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure the younger girls of running after officers.
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?
