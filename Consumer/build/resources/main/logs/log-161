Good Heaven!
how I laughed!
Theres for you!
and so did Mrs.
Are they indeed!
Wickham is safe.
What do you think?
I am glad he is gone.
And Mary King is safe!
Lydia laughed, and said:	
But he is an ugly fellow!
Have you had any flirting?

Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.
And then when we came away it was such fun!
And then we were so merry all the way home!

we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forsters.

Now I have got some news for you, said Lydia, as they sat down at table.
It is excellent news—capital news—and about a certain person we all like!
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs.
Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty!
I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, Oh!
we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!
But I confess they would have no charms for ME—I should infinitely prefer a book.
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay.
I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.

And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away.
The comfort to HER of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.
It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all.
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.
Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?
She dreaded seeing IPKN Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.
And THAT made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.
She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.
We dressed up Chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun!
Yes, thought Elizabeth, THAT would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once.
To this Mary very gravely replied, Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures!
They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer!

She says Lizzy had better have taken IPKN Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it.
Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickhams name.

Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, Is not this nice?
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.
With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kittys hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.
Forster and me are SUCH friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?
She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of EXPRESSION herself, the coarseness of the SENTIMENT was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kittys and Lydias purchases, were seated in it.
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.

As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.
